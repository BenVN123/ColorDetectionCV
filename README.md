# ColorDetectionCV

ColorDetectionCV is a small Java project that uses the OpenCV library to detect a specified color within a video stream. It uses Swing, Java's GUI toolkit, to create the user interface. I created this application as a proof of concept for [@artemis18715](https://github.com/artemis18715)'s robot vision system.
